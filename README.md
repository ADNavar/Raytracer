# Raytracer

This ray tracing program was assigned to me in my first year at Clemson University. 

The program reads in a text file containing a list of entities, their positions, dimensions and lighting attributes and renders a PPM image displaying these.  

In this program I utilize the Phong reflection model of shading, this process involves calculating the ambient, diffused, and specular reflections of a surface and combining them to emulate a shiny surface.
